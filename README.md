**Professor:** Donald Harter

## Dataset
The dataset consists of eight features used to predict cooling load:
- **Relative Compactness** (Continuous)
- **Surface Area** (Continuous)
- **Wall Area** (Continuous)
- **Roof Area** (Continuous)
- **Overall Height** (Continuous)
- **Orientation** (Categorical and Discrete)
- **Glazing Area** (Continuous)
- **Glazing Area Distribution** (Categorical and Discrete)

### Data Insights:
- Buildings vary in terms of glazing area, glazing area distribution, and orientation.
- The target variable is **Cooling Load**.

## Visualizations and Statistical Analysis
### Exploratory Data Analysis:
- **Scatterplot Matrix:** Used to identify relationships between features.
- **Histograms:** Displayed distributions of variables.

### Descriptive Statistics:
- **Relative Compactness:** Range: 0.62 - 0.98, Mean: 0.76
- **Surface Area:** Range: 514.5 - 808.5, Mean: 671.7
- **Cooling Load:** Range: 10.90 - 48.03, Mean: 24.59

### Correlation Analysis:
- **Relative Compactness** and **Surface Area**: Strong negative correlation (-0.99)
- **Overall Height** and **Roof Area**: Strong negative correlation (-0.97)
- **Cooling Load**: Correlated positively with Relative Compactness (0.63) and Wall Area (0.43), and negatively with Surface Area (-0.67)

## Machine Learning Models
We implemented multiple models for predicting cooling loads:

### 1. **Linear Regression**
- Accuracy: **88.7%**
- High multicollinearity detected in "Roof Area" and "Overall Height" (VIFs: 24.23 and 18.86 respectively).

### 2. **Perceptron Model**
- Initial prediction: 715
- Final prediction after learning: 690
- Accuracy: **58%**

### 3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- Used to find the best decision boundary for classification.

### 4. **Neural Networks**
- Implemented for pattern recognition and predictive analysis.

### 5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Conducted two analyses for classification-based predictions.

### 6. **Na√Øve Bayes**
- Applied for probabilistic classification.

### 7. **Decision Tree**
- Used for hierarchical rule-based classification.

### 8. **Random Forest**
- Applied for improving prediction accuracy by aggregating multiple decision trees.

### 9. **Boosting Algorithms**
- Used for enhancing prediction power.

## Conclusion
The project successfully analyzed the energy efficiency of buildings using statistical methods and machine learning models. The Linear Regression model provided the best predictive power, explaining 88.7% of the variance in cooling loads. Future work could involve hyperparameter tuning and deep learning techniques to improve accuracy.
